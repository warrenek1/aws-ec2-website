# Simple Website Hosted on AWS EC2

This project demonstrates how I deployed a basic static website using an Amazon EC2 instance and Apache HTTP server. It was part of my internship experience and a hands-on way to learn cloud fundamentals, Linux commands, and server configuration.

## What I Did

- Launched a free-tier Amazon EC2 instance (Amazon Linux)
- Connected to the server using SSH and a PEM key
- Installed and configured Apache (httpd)
- Uploaded a custom index.html file
- Set security group rules to allow HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) traffic
- Successfully hosted a live website on the public IP

##  Technologies Used

- AWS EC2
- Linux / Bash (Amazon Linux)
- Apache HTTP Server
- SSH (Git Bash)
- Static HTML

##  Website Preview

> ⚠ The EC2 instance has been stopped to avoid ongoing AWS charges.  
> You can still view the website content in index.html and follow the setup steps in this repo.

## Files Included

- index.html — the sample website page
- README.md — this file

##  What I Learned

- How to start and setup an EC2 instance using SSH
- Basic server setup and Apache configuration
- Managing security group rules
- Understanding the flow of hosting a static site from scratch

## Next Steps

In the future, I plan to:
- Set up a custom domain
- Add SSL with HTTPS (Let's Encrypt)
- Try deploying a dynamic site or using S3/CloudFront
